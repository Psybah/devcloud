# History

DevCloud Partners was born in 2025 with a simple but powerful conviction: **the cloud should be a driver of growth, not a financial burden**.

After years working in DevOps, FinOps, and technology consulting, we saw firsthand how many companies invested heavily in the cloud without achieving the efficiency they expected. Rising bills, oversized infrastructures, and a lack of transparency had become the norm.

That’s why we decided to build something different: a transparent, results-driven, and deeply human service, born in the Canary Islands with a global vision. We want to show that from the islands we can deliver world-class cloud solutions, creating real value for businesses and opportunities for people.

We work side by side with our clients, embedding ourselves in their teams, listening to their needs, and designing tailor-made solutions. **No risks or hidden costs:** only clear, measurable, and shared results.

Our commitment is twofold: to our clients, helping them free up resources to innovate; and to our team, fostering local talent and building a technology hub from the Canary Islands to the world.

In every project, we aim for more than optimizing servers or invoices: we strive to build trust, drive innovation, and create a lasting positive impact.
