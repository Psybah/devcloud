Our Story
How DevCloud Partners came to be

Founded in 2025
DevCloud Partners was born in 2025 with a simple but powerful conviction: the cloud should be a driver of growth, not a financial burden.

Identifying the Problem
After years working in DevOps, FinOps and technology consulting, we saw firsthand how many companies invested heavily in the cloud without achieving the efficiency they expected. Rising bills, oversized infrastructures and a lack of transparency had become the norm.

Building the Solution
That's why we decided to build something different: a transparent, results-driven and deeply human service, born in the Canary Islands with a global vision. We want to show that from the islands we can deliver world-class cloud solutions, creating real value for businesses and opportunities for people.

Our Philosophy
Technology as a tool for growth

At DevCloud Partners we believe that technology is not an end in itself, but a tool for people and companies to grow.

Human-Centered Approach
We work side by side with our clients, embedding ourselves in their teams, listening to their needs and designing tailor-made solutions.

Transparent Partnership
No risks or hidden costs: only clear, measurable and shared results. Our commitment is twofold: to our clients and to our team.

Innovation & Impact
In every project we aim for more than optimizing servers or invoices: we strive to build trust, drive innovation and create a lasting positive impact.

Our commitment is twofold: to our clients, helping them free up resources to innovate, and to our team, fostering local talent and building a technology hub from the Canary Islands to the world.
